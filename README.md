## FAQ 

###  Where is the documentation? Are there any guides for this?

Everything you need is [here](https://xoliper.github.io/ANGE/Ange/Documentation/index.html). You can also download all that documentation (as HTML subpages) from "Ange/Documentation" folder.

### Any example code?

Sure, [here](https://xoliper.github.io/ANGE/Ange/Documentation/1.%20Usage%20example.-Guide.html)!

### Any applications based on this library?

As far as i know - at the moment, no. But I'm currently writing a scene editor for this library. So it will probably be the first app.
